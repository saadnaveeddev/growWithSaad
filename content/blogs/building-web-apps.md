Building modern web applications requires understanding the right tools and frameworks. In this guide, I'll walk you through creating scalable applications with Next.js and modern development practices.

## Choosing the Right Stack

The foundation of any great web app starts with choosing the right technology stack. Here's what I recommend:

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework with excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling

### Backend & Database
- **API Routes**: Built-in API functionality in Next.js
- **Prisma**: Modern database toolkit for TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable and scalable database solution

## Project Structure

Organize your project for maintainability:

```
src/
├── app/           # App Router pages
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── lib/          # Utility functions
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
└── types/        # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Optimize for performance with Next.js features
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Write comprehensive tests

## Deployment

Deploy your application using:
- **Vercel**: Seamless Next.js deployment
- **Railway**: Simple database hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

Building modern web apps is about choosing the right tools and following established patterns. Start simple, then scale as your application grows.
