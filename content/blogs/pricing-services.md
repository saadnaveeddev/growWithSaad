One of the most challenging decisions for new freelancers is how to price their services. Price too low, and you'll burn out. Price too high, and you won't get clients. Here's how to find the sweet spot.

## Calculate Your Hourly Rate

Start by determining how much you need to earn annually. Then work backward to find your hourly rate.

### The Formula

- Annual income goal: $50,000
- Working hours per year: 1,920 (40 hours × 48 weeks)
- Hourly rate: $26/hour

Add 20-30% for non-billable time and taxes.

## Value-Based Pricing

Instead of charging by the hour, charge based on the value you provide. A project that saves a client $10,000 is worth more than the time it takes.

## Common Pricing Models

- Hourly rates
- Project-based pricing
- Retainer agreements
- Performance-based pricing

## Adjusting Your Prices

As you gain experience and testimonials, increase your prices. Your early clients helped you build credibility—it's okay to charge more as you progress.
