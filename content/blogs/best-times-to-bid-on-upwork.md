# Best Times to Bid on Upwork: Boost Your Freelance Win Rate (With Pakistani Time)

Success on freelancing platforms like Upwork depends not just on skills, but also on timing, strategy, and proposal quality. Sending proposals at the right time can dramatically improve your response rate and chances of winning projects. In this guide, we will break down the best bidding times, include Pakistani Time (PKT) for each window, and give you a strategy to maximize your Upwork success.

## Golden Hours to Submit Proposals

Research and community insights suggest certain time windows have higher engagement and hiring rates:

### Morning (Client Time: 6:00‑8:30 AM)

- US clients (ET): 3:00‑5:30 PM PKT
- UK clients (GMT): 11:00 AM‑1:30 PM PKT

Early applications face less competition and get noticed faster.

### Late Morning (10:30 AM‑12:00 PM)

- US clients: 7:30‑9:00 PM PKT
- Europe clients: 2:30‑4:00 PM PKT

Clients are reviewing tasks and planning their day, giving your proposal visibility.

### Evening (4:00‑6:00 PM)

- US clients: 1:00‑3:00 AM PKT (next day)
- UK clients: 9:00‑11:00 PM PKT

Clients often shortlist candidates or make hiring decisions during this window.

Best days to bid: Tuesday and Wednesday for higher response and engagement rates.

## Client Region-Specific Timing

Adjust your bidding schedule based on client location:

US (ET/PT): 9:00‑11:30 AM → 6:00‑8:30 PM PKT (ET) / 9:00‑11:30 PM PKT (PT)

Europe / UK: 8:30‑10:30 AM & 1:00‑3:00 PM → 1:30‑3:30 PM PKT & 5:30‑7:30 PM PKT

APAC: 9:00‑11:00 AM & 2:00‑4:00 PM → 9:00‑11:00 AM PKT & 2:00‑4:00 PM PKT (depending on region)

## Combine Speed and Quality

- Speed to Lead: Send proposals quickly after job postings appear. Fresh proposals are prioritized.
- Quality Matters: Customize proposals to client needs. Clearly highlight pain points and how you can solve them.
- Follow-Up: Send a short follow-up 24–72 hours after submitting your proposal to improve engagement.

## Use "Boost Proposal" Wisely

- Use the Boost Proposal feature when the job is new and your proposal is strong.
- Boosted proposals appear on top and increase visibility for hiring clients.

## Avoid Common Mistakes

- Sending generic proposals
- Ignoring client time zones
- Having an incomplete profile
- Responding slowly

## Personalized Strategy for Pakistani Freelancers

1. Identify Client Region: Calculate the best PKT window for proposals.
2. Bidding Sprints: Schedule 2–3 daily sessions to submit fresh proposals.
3. Custom Proposals: Tailor each proposal to the client and project.
4. Follow-Up Plan: Send follow-ups 24–72 hours after submission.
5. Track Results: Monitor which timing and approach yield the best response rate.

## Final Thoughts

Winning on Upwork is not luck, it is timing, strategy, and personalized proposals. Submitting proposals during golden hours, mid-week, and client-specific windows, while maintaining quality and speed, can significantly improve your hiring chances. Use these strategies and watch your freelance success grow.
